# ðŸ‘€ Product Overview

> Split! is a tool designed to help users easily split bills. By scanning bills and utilizing OCR and GPT APIs, it automatically generates draggable item entries. Users can then allocate these items to group members through a graphical interface, simplifying the bill-splitting process. The target users include groups of friends who often dine out or shop together, small teams, roommates, and similar groups.
